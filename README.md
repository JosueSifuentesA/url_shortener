# URL Shortener
This is a web-based URL shortener that utilizes the https://shrtco.de API to shorten user-entered URLs. The shortened URLs can then be easily copied and used, and will persist across page refreshes.

# Usage
To use the URL shortener, simply enter a valid URL into the input field and click the "Shorten" button. The shortened URL will be displayed below, along with the original URL for reference.

To copy the shortened URL to the clipboard, click the "Copy" button next to it.

The shortened URLs are persisted across page refreshes using browser local storage. This means that if you close the page and come back later, your shortened URLs will still be available.
